My name is Ellen Gummesson and I love communication and the web. I recently recieved a degree in media and communication studies, specialising in strategic communication. Lately I've been diving straight into front-end development, mainly writing HTML5 and CSS3, dabbling a little bit with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and starting to really enjoy JavaScript. I also like [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and love [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).

I've also started to learn the programming language [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) and I'm hoping that one day I'll conquer the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) framework. In the meantime I'm having fun with micro web framework [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/). I enjoy writing small but practically useless [Bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell) "Bash") scripts that I run on my [Debian Testing](http://www.debian.org/releases/testing/) box. You can check out [my projects on Gitub](https://github.com/gummesson/) if you'd like, although I'm still very much a beginner when it comes to coding.

## Why are you writing this in english?

I see it both as a fun challenge and an learning experience. English is a pretty important language and even though I think I'm pretty good at both speaking writing it there's always room for improvement.

## Colophon

[This site](http://ellengummesson.com/) is powered by [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). It was built with HTML5, CSS3 and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) with [Compass](http://compass-style.org/). The code was written by hand in [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) with the colorscheme [Tomorrow Night Eighties](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme/blob/master/vim/colors/Tomorrow-Night-Eighties.vim). The site makes use of the rather nice looking typefaces [Noto Sans](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Noto+Sans) and [Sanchez](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Sanchez), which are provided by [Google Webfonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts).

The blog posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), scribbled down in [Pop](http://minimaltools.com/), [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/) or [ResophNotes](http://resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html) before finally ending up and being finished in [FocusWriter](http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/), [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) or occasionally in [MarkdownPad](http://www.mardownpad.com/). [Shotty](http://shotty.devs-on.net/en/Overview.aspx) is used for taking the screenshots.
