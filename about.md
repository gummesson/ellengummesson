My name is Ellen Gummesson and I &hearts; the web. I recently recieved a degree in media and communication studies, specializing in strategic communication. Lately I've been diving straight into front-end development, mainly writing HTML and CSS and dabbling with JavaScript. I really love [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) too.

I've started to learn [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/) and I'm hoping that one day I'll conquer it or atleast comprehend it. I've also played around a bit with [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). I enjoy writing small but practically useless shell scripts that I run on my [Debian Testing](http://ellengummesson.com/notes/the-linux-setup) box. You can check out [my beginner-esque projects](https://github.com/gummesson/) if you'd like.

## Colophon

This site is powered by [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). It was built with HTML5, CSS3 and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). The code was written by hand in [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). It uses the rather nice looking typeface [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Open+Sans), which is provided by [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts).

The blog posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), scribbled down in [Pop](http://minimaltools.com/), [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/) or [ResophNotes](http://resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html) before finally ending up and being finished in [FocusWriter](http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/) or [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). [Shotty](http://shotty.devs-on.net/en/Overview.aspx) is used for taking the screenshots.
