I've been thinking a lot lately about yet again redesigning this site. I've changed quite a few annonyances I've had since launching the new design back in September but I'm still not fully content with it. I guess that's the way it is when you constantly pick up new things from other sites and blogs that you regularly go to. I have a tendency to get extremely tired at looking at the same thing for longer periods of time too. I think that's why I've been tinkering so much with my current design. If I could I'd probably change the site every month, but that's an impossible feat since I'm not a designer at all. I rarely get by in that department. But still I feel a need to strive for something more aesthetically pleasing. Or maybe I just care too much and should just let it be. I don't know.
