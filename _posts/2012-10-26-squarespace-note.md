> A free minimalist iOS app that anyone can use to capture all their thoughts, ideas, and inspirations.

[Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com/) just released a simple note taking app. I love the interface but I wish I could choose which folder in Dropbox that I want to sync my notes to, since I already have one for all the ones I've previously written. The app is completely free though so I shouldn't really complain.
