Go ahead and press `J` and `K`. Oh look, the page scrolls just like in [Vim](http://www.vim.org/).[^20130331-1] After playing around with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) I felt that it was appropriate to implement it as a sign of appreciation for my text editor of choice. A demo is available on [my jsFiddle account](http://jsfiddle.net/gummesson/Jyp98/), although I use a slightly modified version of it. As of know you can only use it to scroll up and down but I may try to add a few more keybindings later.

[^20130331-1]: Or so I hope. It works perfectly fine on my end, but I haven't tested it in that many browsers yet.
