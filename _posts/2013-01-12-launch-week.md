Yesterday I finally pushed something to the master branch of a thing I started working on last week, [Smallwork](# "Smallwork"). It's a small yet full featured [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/ "SCSS") framework, or starting point as I'd like to call it. The first time I tried SCSS was way back in August or September but I didn't really "get" it until I started learning Ruby. The code length measures in at a total of 1156 numbers of lines[^20130112-1] which kind of makes it my most ambitious work to date.

I also played around with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/ "Sinatra") again and came up with a simple journal app which uses [Datamapper](http://datamapper.org/ "Datamapper") and [SQLite3](http://www.sqlite.org/ "SQLite 3") for storing everything in a database. Like I mentioned earlier I'm quite fond of Sinatra, especially since it's really easy to understand what do to and what's going on. The code is so self-explanatory that I sometimes have to pinch myself to see that I'm not in fact dreaming. I'm no expert but I like where I'm going with it and I've barely scratched the surface.

I'm also thinking about extending [Kramit!](http://kramit.ellengummesson.com/ "Kramit!") a bit, but we'll see how that goes... I guess I should try to slow myself down a bit since I've launched three new projects this week alone. I'm having fun though!

[^20130112-1]: That's including blank lines and comments. It's still a pretty big number though. The compiled CSS code is 682 lines long and that's without any additional content besides the basic structure itself.
