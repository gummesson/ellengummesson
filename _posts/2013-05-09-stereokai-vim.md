Lately I've really started to enjoy [the Monokai theme](http://www.monokai.nl/blog/2006/07/15/textmate-color-theme/ "Monokai"). There's a couple of different versions out there for [Vim](http://www.vim.org "Vim") and my favorite is [Monokai-Refined](https://github.com/jaromero/vim-monokai-refined "Monokai-Refined on Github"). However, Vim's way of handling highlighting can sometimes be quite weird so I decided to add some minor tweaks so that it looks especially good when your writing HTML, CSS and Javascript and make it available in a repository. I don't know if it'll replace my beloved [Tomorrow Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme "Tomorrow Theme on Github") or [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized "Solarized"), but it's definitively a close third atleast.
