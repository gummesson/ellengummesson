I'm hanging on to my experiment with [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) and a few minutes ago I open sourced yet another small library with yet another unimaginative name: [file.lua](https://github.com/gummesson/file.lua). It basically just a few helper functions for dealing with files. I'm still finding it to be a fun language, which feels pretty nice! I'm still on the fence about whether or not I should release my projects on [LuaRocks](http://luarocks.org/), since they feel pretty insignificant compared to some on the projects on there. We'll see, I guess.
