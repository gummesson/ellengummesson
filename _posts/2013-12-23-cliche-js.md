For the first time in a couple of weeks I'm releasing a new thing: [Cliche.js](https://github.com/gummesson/cliche.js). It's a small library for mapping JavaScript click events. Instead of having to use `document.querySelector` and `target.addEventListener` over and over again[^1] you can do this:

    var someFunction = function() {
      // ...  
    };

    var anotherFunction = function(event) {
      var target = event.target;
      // ...  
    };

    Cliche({
      '#some-selector'    : someFunction,
      '#another-selector' : anotherFunction
    });

I think it looks pretty neat. For simplicity it currently only supports IE9+, but you can easily use a couple of polyfills to get it to work in other browsers.

[^1]: Although if you're mapping a lot of events you probably should be using `event.target` with a few selected event listeners instead.
