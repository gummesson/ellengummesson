Earlier today I pushed a new project to Github called [Helper.js](https://github.com/gummesson/helper.js). It basically a minimal[^20130526-1] JavaScript library for basic DOM manipulation tasks, which supports Internet Explorer 8 and above. It obviously ain't as versatile as [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com/), but it gets the job done for simpler stuff. I've tried it out in some older browsers but it's probably likely that it has some bugs and sharp edges. As always I mostly wrote it just for fun and to learn the ins and outs of working with the DOM and structuring objects and the like in JavaScript. After 380 lines of code I feel much more confident but still very much like a novice.
