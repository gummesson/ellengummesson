The time has come for me to yet again change the design of this website. This time I went nearly all in on using [BEM](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) as my CSS coding style of choice and utilizing [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) as the base for the overall element styling and vertical rhythm. I also use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for all of my automation, including building and generating the actual site[^20130903-1]. I've replaced the jQuery code with pure JavaScript too[^20130903-2] and I threw together a nifty mobile navigation solution which I think works quite well.

[^20130903-1]: This not entirely by pure choice, since Jekyll hates my computer's default encoding and thus is giving me all sorts of errors, but it works really well.
[^20130903-2]: I actually did that a week or two ago but I never really got around to writing about it.
