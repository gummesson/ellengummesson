The iPhone/iPad version of [iA Writer](http://itunes.apple.com/se/app/ia-writer/id392502056?mt=8) (which I use) got an update just in time for the release of iOS 6, and I'm really happy about the fact that it now finally has a Markdown preview mode. I was actually looking around for another app that had a function like that, but now I think I'm going to stick around with using it (even though [Drafts](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8) looks good too).

I'm not that keen on how the text in the preview is formatted, but it's no the end of the world because I don't really use the app to write huge text pieces on my phone or anything like that. I think I'm good as long as I'm just using for capturing quick notes with ideas for blog posts and other writing related stuff.
