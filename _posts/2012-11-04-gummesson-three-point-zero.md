If you're reading this you should've noticed that the design once again has changed. I tried to made a promise to myself that I wouldn't fiddle with the site's design for a week but obviously that didn't work out. I did find a rather stunning typeface, [Tinos](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Tinos), and I decided to run with it while the inspiration was high. I think that it looks so much cleaner now and I've finally limited my need to change things around on the site. I'm confident that this reincarnation of it will stick around much longer than the previous ones (that shouldn't be too hard since I've had two different designs since the end of August this year).

*I really need to find a good monthly archives plugin for Jekyll though since the post count is getting too high to work with the current solution which just lists them all, but that's a different story.*
