Now that I've had this blog for a while I thought it would be a good idea to write about how my so called workflow looks to wrap this whole Jekyll series up.

## 1. Writing In MarkdownPad

I first fire up [MarkdownPad](http://www.markdownpad.com/) and start writing a new blog post. It's a really nifty little tool for us Mac-depraved Windows users. I use DejaVu Sans Mono (which is my choice for coding purposes too) as my default font with `#FF434343` as the font color and `#FFF2F2F2` as the background color.

## 2. Running Jekyll Locally

After I'm done with my writing, I fire up the command line and run Jekyll to generate my site. I also skim through my blog post to make sure that I haven't accidentally made a typo or something to that effect.

## 3. Pushing To GitHub

Last but not least, I open up [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/ "GitHub for Windows") and push my site to GitHub. Even though it's not the most convenient thing to do it's still pretty easy and it makes the transfer so much faster with no hassles.

**Note:** GitHub Pages (where I host my site) can actually run Jekyll and generate your site automatically but you can't use your own plugins, so that's why I'm deploying my static pages rather than just the source itself.

And that's it! You could argue that it sounds a lot like overkill, but it works for me. Sure, I can't upgrade something without sitting infront of my computer, but I know that I'd never update from a phone or email anyways. It really makes me think twice before I publish something too, which I like.
