Around a week ago [I wrote about AutoHotKey](/blog/2012/10/29/hotstrings-and-markdown/) and how it could be used when it came to more general things like using abbreviations for your name or website in order to speed up your writing. I also wrote a bit about how to use it to make your markdown writing even faster. I finally sat down and played around with different ways to create more efficient scripts and came up with a couple of new things. I also figured out how to move the cursor's position so you can start typing right away instead of having to manually move it[^20121110-1]. I put them up for download on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/gummesson) so if you're looking for something like that go ahead and use it and feel free to adjust it to your liking.

[^20121110-1]: The cursor gets placed somewhere inside the actual Markdown snippet. It's pretty handy.
