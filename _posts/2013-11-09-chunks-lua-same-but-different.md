Since Lua's standard library is [relatively small](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/#functions) compared to a lot of languages I decided to port my [Chunks](https://github.com/gummesson/chunks) library over to it, so let me present: [Chunks for Lua](https://github.com/gummesson/chunks.lua). It was actually quite fun to solve the same "problems" in a different language, even though Lua isn't that much of a change from JavaScript.
