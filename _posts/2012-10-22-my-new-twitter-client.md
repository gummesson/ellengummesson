After a hectic search for a replacement for [Echofon](http://blog.echofon.com/2012/10/changes-coming-for-echofon-desktop-users.html) I think I've finally stumbled upon something that'll work for me, [Hotot](http://hotot.org/). Like many apps I use it's both open source and cross platform though it's mainly developed for the Linux environment. Although the website states that the Windows version is "very unstable" I haven't had any problems with it yet. It's not as pretty and clean as Echofon but the fact that it's still decently minimal and it has a one column layout makes it worth using in my opinion. I did try out [Sobees](http://www.sobees.com/social-media-clients/sobees-desktop-application) and [Nymphicus](http://www.nymphicusapp.com/windows/). For some reason Sobees wouldn't let me stay logged in and Nymphicus' interface didn't strike a chord with me.

The login screen leaves a lot to be desired but I actually really like the buttons that's at the top of the default interface. It's quite reminiscent of Tapbots' [Tweetbot for Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-for-twitter/id557168941?mt=12). I've noticed that it sometimes takes a couple of minutes for it to notify me about mentions and messages, but I think I'm just spoiled with other apps in that regard. I do hope that the development of it continues but I guess my backup plan is to use [Tweetdeck](http://tweetdeck.com/) since it's the official client for Twitter. I'm not it's biggest fan though.
