I've been meaning to change the [archives](/archives) for a long time since having all the posts in a single list doesn't look that great and can become quite messy after awhile. Thanks to the magic wonders of Google I found a a really neat solution: a small plugin[^20121111-1] that sorts your posts by month and year. It goes through all your posts and just generates a simple single `archives.html` page which is exactly want I wanted. It amazes me that people actually takes time and just write code that'll help someone like me tremendously. I'm extremely thankful for that.
