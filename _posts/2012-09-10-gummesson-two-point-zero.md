I decided to make the jump and thus this site now has a spanking new design. [Oswald](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Oswald) is used for the headings and the navigation and [Asap](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Asap) is used for the body copy. I quite like them together since the former has a kind of slab-serif quality to it, even though it's actually a sans-serif. The bold and italic versions of Asap aren't perfect, but they look much better than than they did before. I haven't had the chance you check out how they look in *Firefox* and *Opera*, but I hope they look good in them too. I've also increased the font size from 112.5% (which usually equals to 18px) to 125% (20px) just because I'm a big fan of having a bigger size for readability.
