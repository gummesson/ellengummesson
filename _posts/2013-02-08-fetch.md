I've released yet another one of my *Mostly Uselessâ„¢* projects, [Fetch](https://github.com/gummesson/fetch), which let's you grab a couple of web development resources straight from the command line. Package managers seem to be something that pops up every once in a while. Among them there's [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/), [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and of course the good old [apt-get](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool), which I use from time to time. They're lovely tools but as I'm nothing more than a hobbyist they're a bit overkill for me, so I took a run at creating something a lot more simpler. I wouldn't really call it a package manager but more of a component catcher though. I'm thinking of implementing [JSON](http://www.json.org/) into it instead of using [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/), but we'll see how that goes. One thing I really need to do is to step up my game and actually start to learn more. I feel that I've been staying in the same spot knowledge-wise for quite some time now and it's time to start to progress again. But I digress.

One a side note, I finally figured out why I couldn't get my [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) projects to run under [Crunchbang Linux](http://crunchbang.org/). I'd literally forgotten the "whole shebang", ie: `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`, at the start. **Head, prepare to meet desk**.
