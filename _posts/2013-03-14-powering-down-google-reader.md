Even though I've tried to trim down my subscriptions I'm still a big fan of [Google Reader](ww.google.com/reader) and it's a shame that they're pulling the plug on it. I switched to [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com/home) earlier today and it seems to do the job fairly well. The iOS app is beautiful too but I'm not completely sold on the whole magazine-like interface. The intergration with other web services is pretty amazing though.
