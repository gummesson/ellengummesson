I was getting sick of adding `script` tags in my markup so I wrote a little script that could make it a bit more bearable. What it does is basically looping through an array of files, creating a new tag for each and every script and appends it to the body of the document. It's obviously not meant to be used in production, but It's quite handy when you want to play around.
