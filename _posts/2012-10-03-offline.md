Yesterday while I was traveling a bit by train I read Paul Miller's [offline series](http://www.theverge.com/label/offline "Paul Miller's offline series on The Verge") on The Verge about his year without internet. Admittedly I've previously only skimmed through a couple of the articles, but I decided to catch up on all of them since I had some time to kill during my ride. I think it's an intriguing idea yet at the same time a bit nightmarish. I mean, without an internet connection I wouldn't even have read the articles. I think that a lot of people around my age can all relate to living their lives in some form or another through the internet and I'd probably be bored to death if I couldn't use it at all. It might be sad, but it's true nonetheless. The feeling of not being able to have an immediate access to instant information about pretty much anything would be more than overwhelming. I don't know if I should feel bad about it either... Perhaps not, I guess?
