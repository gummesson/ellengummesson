A couple of days ago my new hard drive that I bought a mere three weeks ago decided that it was time to make my life not so fun by giving up. For some reason it failed, and it failed hard. Luckily, I had all of my important files (like this whole site) stored on an external drive and I have a SSD where I can keep my OS and all of my programs and such, but some of my other files are forever lost. It sucks, but I'll survive. My brother (who really helped med out) fought like a champ trying to get it to work, but it was a lost cause. In the process of trying to save my new hard drive I also had to wipe my SSD too. It took quite a while to install everything again, but now it's all up and running. The "failed to sync branch" problem I had earlier with GitHub is also gone, which I guess you could say is good, even though I would've rather had that problem than going trough this whole ordeal. 

I don't really know if I'm more sad or more angry though. Sure, it's really important that you take backups of everything that you want to keep and store, but I don't think I really can blame myself entirely in this case. I mean, you don't really except a hard drive that you've barely used to break down and just fail on you so suddenly. On the other hand I do want to kick myself in the head, atleast just a little bit. Oh well. Sometimes we think that computers are these indestructible things that can do no wrong, but I guess that's not really the case. Now I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I can get it replaced without any hassles, but that shouldn't really be a problem. I hope.
