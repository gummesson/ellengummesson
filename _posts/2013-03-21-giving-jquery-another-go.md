A few months ago I started to play around with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ "jQuery"). Given that I was much more new to coding then it sadly didn't take me long before I kind of gave up. After playing around with [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/ "Ruby") for a few months I decided to give jQuery another go and so far I think that I've got the basics down. Ruby and jQuery are totally different, but after learning the general basics of coding it's been relatively easy to pick it up[^20130321-1]. I'm obviously very much a beginner though. I've thrown together a few simple scripts[^20130321-2] in a GitHub repo that I've appropriately named "[yayQuery](https://github.com/gummesson/yayquery "yayQuery")" that might come in handy. It's been pretty fun and who knows, some day I might get the hang of this whole front-end development thing?

[^20130321-1]: Especially when the syntax is quite easy for common things, like `hide()` and `show()`.
[^20130321-2]: I've currently figured out how to scroll smoothly to IDs using anchors, how to make a dropdown menu and a simple slideshow. Yay indeed.
