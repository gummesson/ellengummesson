This is such a simple but nice-to-have thing. I really like using [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) instead of having to completely wiping the styling of every element and I've to used my own mini reset with it to remove some of the default values like margins and paddings. I guess that I don't have to do that anymore!
