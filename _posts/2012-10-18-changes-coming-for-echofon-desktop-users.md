> Beginning this Fall, we will begin phasing out our Echofon desktop products (Mac, Windows, Firefox) in order to focus more on our mobile line of Echofon apps.

This is such a shame. [Echofon](http://www.echofon.com/) is probably the best one column Twitter client for Windows users (if not the only one). I guess I need to find something else then.
