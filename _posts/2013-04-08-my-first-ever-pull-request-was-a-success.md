So yesterday I sent my first pull request ever and it actually got merged. My addition was adding a link to Airbnb's [JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) in a [repository that collects a bunch of styleguides](https://github.com/gregstallings/styleguides). It may not be the most exciting thing ever but I guess that I can now officially call myself an open source contributor, right?
