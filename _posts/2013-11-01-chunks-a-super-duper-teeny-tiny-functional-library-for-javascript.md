Lately I've been getting into a more functional approach to programming and I decided to write a simple library for JavaScript, which I named "[Chunks](https://github.com/gummesson/chunks)". I know that there's a plethora of them available, but it's always fun to learn by doing. It currently consists of 18 functions that I consider the most commonly used and helpful ones. I might add a couple of more someday but my main goal is to keep it lightweight. As of right now it's around 2 kb minified and about 0.42 kb minified and gzipped.

Oh, and here's a fun aside: the library's currently 343 lines long (with many comments) while the tests take up a total of 504 lines (with barely any comments).

Happy (functional) programming!
