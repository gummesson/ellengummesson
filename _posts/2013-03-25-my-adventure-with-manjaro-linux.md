After a few months of using [Crunchbang Linux](http://crunchbang.org/), which is based on [Debian](http://www.debian.org/), I decided to switch to [Manjaro Linux](http://manjaro.org/) instead. Even though I really like Crunchbang I wanted to have a go at using a [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) based system, mainly because of the rolling release cycle. I've also heard that the package manager, [Pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman)[^20130325-1] is fantastic. I didn't really want to install it from scratch though[^20130325-2] and that's when discovered Manjaro. I might do it at some other point, but I really like nothing having to install everything by myself. What's even more awesome that it came with [Openbox](http://openbox.org/) edition, which I'm a big fan of. I know that Arch has a reputation of breaking constantly, but since I'm going to use it on a secondary machine it doesn't bother me much. I might even learn something from a little breakage, although I hope I won't encounter it too often.

[^20130325-1]: Which is an amazing name, by the way.
[^20130325-2]: Know your limitations. I'm sure that I wouldn't have succeed with it.
