Earlier today I released a simple project I hacked together this past weekend: [Codely](https://github.com/gummesson/codely). I've wanted to try out [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) for a long time but couldn't really find a reason to use it until a couple of days ago. I love the Vim mode even though I can't seem to get `Esc` key to work in it... But I digress. It was fun to try out the [Notification](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-notifications-20130912/) API too. It's amazing what you can do with a web browser these days.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Besides the normal keyboard shortcuts you would use in Vim or Emacs mode (or with [Emmet](https://github.com/emmetio/codemirror) plugin) I also added a few additional shortcuts:

| Keys  | Action                 |
|-------|------------------------|
| `F10` | Save the content       |
| `F11` | Toggle fullscreen mode |

I might add some kind of help dialog later on, but we'll see.
