After reading the above post yesterday I finally took the plunge and switched to [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) from [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen). I already love it. Removing Git submodules is still a bit of a pain though so I used [this script by Adam Sharp](https://gist.github.com/sharplet/6289697), which made it a lot easier. Now I'm off to trying out about a million different plugins!
