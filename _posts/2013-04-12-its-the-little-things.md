A couple of days ago Chris Coyier [wrote an interesting post](http://css-tricks.com/can-you-over-organize-javascript/) asking if you can over organize your JavaScript. Since I just started to learn it "properly" I decided to challenge myself by [re-writing the code](http://snippi.com/s/r5kl9vo) he had posted. He responded with [this comment](http://css-tricks.com/can-you-over-organize-javascript/#comment-366077):
