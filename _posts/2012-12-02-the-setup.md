One of my favorite sites on the web is the [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/). The tagline for it is *"What do people use to get stuff done?"*, which describes the purpose of it really well. It may be the nerd in me but I find it completely fascinating to see what kind of gear and software people in all kind of job fields use[^20121202-1]. If you haven't checked it out and you're as geeky as I am I suggest that you should. There's also a couple of [spin-offs](http://usesthis.com/community/) of the whole idea, which ranges from Linux users to teachers to people with disabilities. I've been toying with the idea of doing something like that but haven't had the time nor the resources to do so just yet. All in all it's a little fantastic website that I thoroughly enjoy.
