A couple of months back I wrote a blog post called *["The Joys of Writing"](/blog/2012/09/20/the-joys-of-writing/ "The Joys Of Writing")* where I expressed my love for the craft that is writing. While I still feel the same I've also found it quite hard from time to time, especially during the last couple of weeks. In other words, the honeymoon period of starting this website is over. I sit down, launch [ResophNotes](http://resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html), look through my notes and find a topic I want to write about but absolutely nothing comes out. Not even a word. It's a good old-fashioned writer's block and I hate it. Even though I probably have a very low number of readers[^20121209-1] I still like to write and I feel quite powerless when I can't do so. In short, writing keeps me sane. 

I realize as I type this out that this blog post has a goodbye vibe written all over it, but fortunately that's not the case. I just need to vent out some of my frustration. I'm going to keep fighting it and I hope that I'll come out of it sooner than later. I guess that in a sense this post is already a step in the right direction.

[^20121209-1]: [As I've stated before](/blog/2012/09/20/the-joys-of-writing/), I don't use any kind of analytics on this website so I haven't got a clue about the readership.
