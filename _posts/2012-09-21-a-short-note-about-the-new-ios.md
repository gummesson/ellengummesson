The battery life on my *iPhone 4S* has improved when I'm not using 3G or WiFi...but it's gotten worse when I'm actually using something that requires an internet connection to work. Granted I only upgraded to *iOS 6* about two days ago, so maybe it'll get better with time.

One step forward and one step back, I guess?
