> Ferro is a Google Chrome extension that functions similarly to application launchers like Quicksilver, Launchy, and GNOME Do, but it can do much more than just open apps. Using only your keyboard, you can quickly open pages in your history or bookmarks, open extension options pages, and save your current tabs for opening later. You can also perform many other commands, such as deleting a bookmark, disabling an extension, and pinning a tab.

Pretty cool!
