It's been nearly a week since I started with venturing into [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and so far it's really been an adventure for sure. I've managed to pick up a few new tricks everyday and yesterday I had to stop myself from saving a quick note I was jotting down in another editor with `:w`[^20130103-1] which I guess is a good thing. I've also managed to scrap together a decent `.vimrc` file with lots of settings and installed quite a few plugins as well. I feel that using Vim makes me atleast *feel* a bit more efficient and while the learning curve is steep I do think that I'll continue to use it. I've always been lazy when it comes to learning keyboard shortcuts and even though I think that you should use whatever feels most comfortable to you it's defintively not a bad thing to be able to move around and edit things fast without having to use the mouse. 

I've also started a new project[^20130103-2] and decided that I'll only work on it in Vim just to get a good feel for it and to learn how to actually use all the basic ways to get by atleast. That'll probably prove to be a challenge, but fun nonetheless. I have a lot to learn but I'm equally eager to do that.

[^20130103-1]: The default way of saving things in Vim.
[^20130103-2]: Or a thing. The word "project" sounds so serious.
