By being bored and wanting to have something to do I made a couple of themes for *FocusWriter* based on other editors like [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/) and [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/) and color schemes like [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). You can check out some screenshots of them by either clicking on this post's title (I finally get the chance to use an external link!) or right [here](/projects/focuswriter-themes/), if you'd rather want that. They're also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gummesson/focuswriter-themes).
