[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which this website is built with, just got a new release with a ton of minor enhancements and bug fixes after nearly a year of silence. It's nice to know that the development will continue since I think that Jekyll is pretty awesome. I haven't had time to play around with it a whole lot but the nicest new feature that I've stumble upon up until this point is in my opinion the ability to specify the path to your pagination pages. 

I previously had to use a quite ugly hack that involved copying and changing the source code itself and place it in my `_plugins` folder. Now the only thing that I had to do was to add the below line in my `_config.yml` file:

	paginate_path: blog/page/:num

It has the same functionality as my own fiddling but it's a hell of a lot easier than having to change the code directly.
