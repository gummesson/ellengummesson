After a few hours of hacking spreading out during these last couple of days I'm releasing yet another [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) thing called [Servera](https://npmjs.org/package/servera)[^20130920-1]. It's a small app for managing and serving all your local static sites by configuring all your projects in a single `json` file. The idea is to map them by using this convention:

    {
      "myproject": {
        "dir": "/home/USERNAME/Dev/myproject",
        "port": 3000
      },
      "anotherproject": {
        "dir": "C:/Users/USERNAME/Dev/anotherproject",
        "port": 6000
      }
    }

The only thing you need to do to launch the server is to run `servera myproject` and then go to `localhost:3000` (or whatever port you've specified) in your browser. You can also serve the current working directory by running `servera .` and you can list all your projects with `servera list`.

It's heavily inspired by [distra](https://npmjs.org/package/distra), although it's a dumbed down version without the whole `/etc/hosts` configuration part[^20130920-2]. I've tested it on both Windows and Linux, and it should hopefully work on OS X too. 

It's a pretty simple thing, but I feel that it could actually be useful.

## Under the hood

`Servera` uses four additional modules: [fs-extra](https://npmjs.org/package/fs-extra), [connect](https://npmjs.org/package/connect), [colors](https://npmjs.org/package/colors) and [commander](https://npmjs.org/package/commander). `fs-extra` is used for copying the sample configuration file to your home directory while `connect` is the main server. `colors` is used to colorize the output in the terminal and `commander` handles the argument parsing.

It's all pretty basic stuff, but together they work really well.

[^20130920-1]: Which is the swedish word for "serve". I'm original like that.
[^20130920-2]: I'm pretty sure that there's no easy way of doing that on Windows without using brute force or some other vodoo.
