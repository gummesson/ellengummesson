I've mentioned before how I love to read about [other](http://onethingwell.org/linux-setup) [people's](http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2010/10/04/the-setup/) setups so I decided to throw together a quite detailed but comprehensive document of what I currently use for my Linux setup and how to actually set it up[^20130823-1]. So far I'm happy with what I'm using but I plan to keep it up to date if I decide to add or change something.

[^20130823-1]: Those notes are mainly written for me, but I figured that it might be useful for someone else too.
