I've been thinking about really learning [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) lately. JavaScript have quickly evolved to become possibly my favorite language, although [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) will always have a special place in my heart. After a quick Google search and an itch I decided to create something small and mostly useless, as always[^20130914-1]. Internet, meet [plit](https://npmjs.org/package/plit)!

## plit

`plit` is an extremely simple [Placehold.it](http://placehold.it/) command line tool. You specify what size you want by running `plit 300x200` and it'll then return the formatted URL, like this: `http://placehold.it/300x200`. That's it. It's not earth shattering, but it's something!

## Closing thoughts

It actually felt a bit "weird", but equally refreshing, to be able to write JavaScript that's not running in a browser. I'm definitively looking forward to write more applications and the like.

As a side note I would like to praise Node.js' and [npm](https://npmjs.org/)'s Windows support. Everything works well right out of the box and I didn't have to configure anything. Now that's simply amazing!
