I just released my first plugin for [gulp](https://npmjs.org/package/gulp) called [gulp-pandoc](https://npmjs.org/package/gulp-pandoc). It's basically just a thin wrapper around a Node.js module called [pdc](https://npmjs.org/package/pdc), which in turn is a small wrapper around the excellent markup converter tool [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). You should check it out if you like Pandoc as much as I do!

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) seems to really hate me at the moment and even though my test suite runs fine locally it throws an huge error at me whenever I push my code up to GitHub. I'm not sure what to do about that...
