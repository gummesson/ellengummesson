I found this little gem of an app earlier today and I got to say that it was just what I was looking for and needed. I've been meaning to minify my code for some time but I haven't found something simple that could do that. There are some web based apps and services out there that can do it, but I like having a native solution so that it can update itself whenever there's a new change and so on.
